# Customer-Segmentation-for-an-E-Commerce-Business
Use clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behaviour and identify strategies to target each group effectively.
# Steps
# 1. Data Collection
You can use datasets such as Kaggle's E-Commerce Data or generate synthetic data with the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
InvoiceNo: Invoice number for each transaction.
PurchaseDate: Date of purchase.
Quantity: Number of items purchased.
Price: Price of each item.
TotalAmount: Total value of the purchase (calculated as Quantity Ã— Price).
# 2. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning ensures the dataset is ready for analysis:

## Handle Missing Values:

Drop rows where CustomerID is missing.
df = df.dropna(subset=['CustomerID'])

## Remove Negative Values:

Filter out rows where Quantity or Price is negative (e.g., returns).
df = df[(df['Quantity'] > 0) & (df['Price'] > 0)]

## Convert Dates to Datetime:

Convert the PurchaseDate column to a datetime object for easier manipulation.

df['PurchaseDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['PurchaseDate'])

## Calculate TotalAmount:

Create a new column to calculate the total amount for each transaction.
df['TotalAmount'] = df['Quantity'] * df['Price']
# 3. Feature Engineering (RFM Analysis)
To perform customer segmentation, we calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) features:

Recency: Days since the last purchase.
Frequency: Total number of transactions for each customer.
Monetary: Total revenue generated by each customer.

from datetime import datetime

reference_date = datetime(2024, 12, 1)
rfm = df.groupby('CustomerID').agg({
    'PurchaseDate': lambda x: (reference_date - x.max()).days,
    'InvoiceNo': 'nunique',
    'TotalAmount': 'sum'
}).rename(columns={'PurchaseDate': 'Recency', 'InvoiceNo': 'Frequency', 'TotalAmount': 'Monetary'})
# 4. Clustering
Normalize the Data:

Standardize the RFM values to ensure fair clustering.

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
rfm_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(rfm)
## Apply K-Means Clustering:

Perform clustering using K-Means with 4 clusters.

from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=42)
rfm['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(rfm_scaled)
Count Customers in Each Cluster:

Display how many customers are in each cluster.

print(rfm['Cluster'].value_counts())

# 5. Visualization
Use visualizations to analyze the clusters and gain insights:

## Pair Plot:

Visualize the relationship between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary for each cluster.

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sns.pairplot(rfm, hue='Cluster', palette='Set2')
plt.show()
## Cluster Analysis:

Compare the mean values of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary across clusters using bar charts.

rfm.groupby('Cluster').mean().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 6))
plt.title('Average RFM Values by Cluster')
plt.show()
# 6. Insights and Recommendations
Based on the clustering results, you can suggest targeted strategies for each group:

## Identify High-Value Customers:

Low Recency, High Frequency, High Monetary.
These customers should be rewarded with loyalty programs or exclusive offers.
Engage Low-Spending Customers:

High Recency, Low Frequency, Low Monetary.
Target these customers with promotions or discounts to encourage more spending.
Re-engage Inactive Customers:

High Recency, Low Frequency, High Monetary.
Send re-engagement emails to remind them of the value they can get from purchasing more.
# Tools Used
## Python Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation.
datetime for date calculations.
Scikit-learn for clustering.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
# Conclusion
By applying clustering techniques to customer data, you can identify valuable customer segments and implement targeted marketing strategies that improve customer retention and drive sales.
